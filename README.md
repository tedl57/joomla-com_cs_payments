joomla-com_cs_payments
===============
This is a Joomla! 3.x component that allows an organization to collect online payments from people that want to  'Join', 'Renew' and/or 'Donate'.  This would be useful for a lot of non-profit organizations in world. 

It collects a person's information and preferred payment reason and then uses either authorize.net or PayPal as the certified payment processor.
